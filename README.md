# Live Scan Console

Synth Scan includes a **real-time scanning console** that simulates penetration testing activity similar to professional security tools.

Example scan logs:
[+] Starting scan
[+] Scanning ports
[+] Discovering directories
[+] Checking SQL Injection
[+] Running security analysis
[+] Scan completed

# Dashboard

After scanning, the platform displays a structured results dashboard including:

- Open Ports
- Discovered Directories
- Technologies Detected
- Vulnerabilities Found
- Risk Score
- Severity Level
